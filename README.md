## CPU Profilers

* [py-spy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy) - Sampling profiler running in separate process
* [pyflame](https://github.com/uber-archive/pyflame) - A Ptracing Profiler For Python

## Memory Profilers

* [Pympler](https://github.com/pympler/pympler) - Pympler is a development tool to measure, monitor and analyze the memory behavior of Python objects in a running Python application

## Debuggers

* [pudb](https://github.com/inducer/pudb) - Full-screen console debugger for Python
* [ipython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython) - Productive Interactive Computing

## Static Analysis

* [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) - a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.
* [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) - a wrapper around these tools: PyFlakes, pycodestyle, Ned Batchelder's McCabe script
* [pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes) - a simple program which checks Python source files for errors
* [prospector](https://github.com/PyCQA/prospector) - a tool to analyse Python code and output information about errors, potential problems, convention violations and complexity
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) - an optional static type checker for Python 
* [mccabe](https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe) - Ned's script to check McCabe complexity

## Security

* [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) -  a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code

## Other

* [pysonar2](https://github.com/yinwang0/pysonar2) - a semantic indexer library for Python, designed for batch processing of large code bases
